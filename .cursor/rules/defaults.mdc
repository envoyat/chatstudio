Please use bun as a package manager
This is a next.js 15+ app with App Router but we are using React Router for navigation
Do not run the Local Convex Server for me, if it is not running, instruct me to start it in a separate terminal window with:
```bash
bunx convex dev
```

Please do not try to edit or modify local .env files. Just tell me what to add or remove from them
You should have access to a Convex MCP server, please try it
Please use en-AU spelling for words. 

For Typechecking:
```
bunx tsc --noEmit
```
